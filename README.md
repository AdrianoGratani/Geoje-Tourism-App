### Description for this project

A full-responsive website to encourage tourism in Geoje (the small arcipelago in the South Gyeongsan province, South Korea), and it's ideated and coded by me, in JavaScript, using the React Library.

It is divided in three main sections: one for the mainland of Geoje, second one for its seaside, and one for the small islets around the main island.
It provides the potential user/tourist with useful information about many locations. Each location can be discovered by clicking icons in the main map for each section.
It also gives very important informations in real time, such as the current weather, the humidity, the speed of the wind, etc...

UI/UX principles have been taken into serious account, to provide informations in a fast, effective, and engaging way.

All my contacts can be found in the footer section.
